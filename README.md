BetterLogixWiresThatCanScroll
=============================

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that optimizes the rendering of LogiX wires by making them use shared materials.

The arrows on the wires can optionally be animated to move towards the target. Using animated wires is no longer "infectious" to other users of this mod.
Whether animated or static wires are spawned can be toggled on the fly in the NML config.  
To switch a wire, it has to be destroyed and re-created - only reconnecting it re-uses the old wire.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [BetterLogixWiresThatCanScroll.dll](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosBetterLogixWiresThatCanScroll/releases/latest/download/BetterLogixWiresThatCanScroll.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
